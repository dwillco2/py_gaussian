Various scripts for the automation of quantum chemical jobs using gaussian, orca, and CREST.

Each job type has its own class, e.g. the GenGaussian class which contains various utilities for automated job submission.

Job submission scripts (.bash) are currently set up for my personal use on Edinburgh's Eddie cluster (OpenPBS), so will need modified for personal use if forking.
